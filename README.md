### Short Bio <br>
I have nearly two decades of experience in high finance and technology, specializing in investment banking, consulting, and venture capital. Throughout my career, I have played multiple roles: operator, investor, and mediator, always aiming to align diverse objectives for mutual benefit. Early in my career as a financial advisor, I recognized the risks that a diminishing middle class posed to both American democracy and global stability.

I was an early advocate of crowdfunding and cryptocurrency, hoping these innovations would democratize access to capital and address the coordination challenges blocking progress on public goods. Regrettably, these solutions have not met expectations, often diverting the efforts and resources of many talented individuals. Despite these setbacks, I remain committed to exploring new pathways that might better support and sustain our collective future.
